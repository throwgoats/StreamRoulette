# StreamRoulette
I watch a lot of movies, and subscribe to a ton of streaming services. But finding a movie to actually watch can be daunting when faced with the paradoxes of paradox of choice, from filtering my Letterboxd watchlist to all the individual queues on each service. Too much!

And I feel like some of the services I pay for don't get used as often, either because their selection is all great (Criterion, Mubi) or the catalog runs crazy deep (Prime). Intimidating!

One thing that has helped me even the odds is to determine first which service to watch and browse from there, either by scrolling though what's in that service's queue, or filtering the Letterboxd watchlist by the chosen service and sorting by random. One less choice!

StreamRoulette is a dumb little web app that helps you randomly select a name from a list of streaming channels. It allows you to add, edit, and delete names from the list, and ensures that the same service is not selected consecutively. It keeps the list and your last choice in local storage so you don't lose your list or the last chosen service.

I use this to pick streamers but you could use it for practically anything you need to get a hit on, like where to grab dinner, what chore to do next, whatever! But you know you're not going to actually follow the choice it makes for dinner, right? You're just going to keep hitting the button until it picks what you want, which is just another way to use the app I guess. There's prolly a psychological term for that, like "choice assertion" or some bullshit.
